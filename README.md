This is a small script written to compare three gochujang recipes against each other.  It pulls recipes from a dict of dicts in gochujang_recipes.py (which would have been JSON or a text file if this weren't a one-off project), asserts that they all have the same ingredients, individually calculates the scale factor to make their total equal to a set amount (1000g in this case), and then formats the output in a [Reddit-friendly markdown table](https://i.imgur.com/Rnjkv.png).  This dict -> markdown function (format_recipes) will be useful for future projects.
